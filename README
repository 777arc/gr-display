gr-display is a small qt based addon for gnuradio to display png images.
I use it to receive and display some weather- satellite pictures with the funcube dongle
and gnuradio.


1. Dependencies:

- gnuradio
- gr-qtgui
- qt4 ( tested with qt4.8 )


2. Installation

get the latest code from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-display

The build process is cmake based. So change to code directory.
There
$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake -DINSTALL_PREFIX=<where gnuradio is install>
$make
$su
$make install

After that you'll find in grc in QT GUI WIDGETS a PNG Image sink.


3. To do

- Saving picture to file.
- Perhaps do some simple image processing like rotating before saving.


4. Using the example

The example is based on the assumtion that the input device is named FCD. This can be achieved
by the following lines in the .asoundrc file in the home directory:

pcm.V10_card {
        type hw
        card V10
}
ctl.V10_card {
        type hw
        card V10
        }
        
pcm.FCD {
        type plug
        slave.pcm V10_card
}


5. Known Problems

You should use libusb-1.0.8. Other versions of libusb or libusbx lead to a sudden finish of the example.
A bug is reported, but up to now there is no fix available.


6. Credits

The apt decoder part is based on an decoder prototype by  Alexandru Csete, OZ9AEC.
